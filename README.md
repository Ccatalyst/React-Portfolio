# React Portfolio Remix


The original intention of this app was to show my proficency in React by building a React porfolio website as a homework project. It's new role is similar.

I plan to build a React portfolio that not only includes the same or similar, with the added feature of showing as many algorithms that I've completed as possible, in "real world" uses. 

To make things easier, I'm going to use Material UI to style the site, to focus more on the algorithm implementation.
