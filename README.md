# React Portfolio Remix


The original intention of this app was to show my proficency in React by building a React porfolio website as a homework project. It's new role is similar.

I plan to build a React portfolio that not only includes the same or similar, with the added feature of showing as many algorithms that I've completed as possible, in "real world" uses.
